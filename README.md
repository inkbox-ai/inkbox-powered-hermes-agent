A fork of [Nous Research's Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) wired up to [Inkbox](https://inkbox.ai). The agent runtime is the same — the difference is every install ships with a **real email address, real phone number, and tunnel runtime** out of the box.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inkbox-ai/hermes-agent/inkbox/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

One command. Installs deps, then walks you through Inkbox self-signup (no account prerequisite), provisions email + phone, and installs the gateway as a background service.

**Windows (early beta):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inkbox-ai/hermes-agent/inkbox/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

WSL2 is the more battle-tested path.

By the end your agent has:

- A real email address (`yourname@inkboxmail.com`) it can send and receive from
- A real phone number that handles inbound SMS and voice
- A persistent identity + contact list that survives across sessions
- A background service that auto-starts on boot, with HMAC-verified webhooks

## What this fork adds

| Capability | Upstream Hermes | This fork |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chat platforms (Telegram, Slack, Discord, …) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Real email address (inbox + outbox) | bring your own SES / SendGrid | ✓ built-in |
| Real phone number (SMS + voice) | bring your own Twilio / SIP | ✓ built-in |
| Public webhook tunnel | host your own server | ✓ via Inkbox SDK |
| Persistent contact list | — | ✓ |
| Account / API key prerequisite | n/a | none — self-signup inline |

Specifically:

- The `inkbox` SDK and `aiohttp` are **core dependencies** (no `[inkbox]` extra to remember)
- `hermes gateway setup` runs Inkbox self-signup inline, mints the API key, writes it to `~/.hermes/.env`
- Tunnel runtime + gateway adapter built in — the agent receives webhooks without you hosting a server
- Gateway service installer wires the runtime into systemd / launchd / Scheduled Task
- HMAC signature verification on inbound webhooks + tunnel traffic

If you want **just the Hermes runtime** and prefer to bring your own SMTP / Twilio / SIP plumbing, use upstream at [`NousResearch/hermes-agent`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

## Synced daily with upstream

We try to sync from [`NousResearch/hermes-agent`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) daily.

## Hermes itself

Everything beyond the Inkbox wiring — the CLI, supported models, skills, memory, tools, terminal backends, scheduled jobs, RL training, contributing — is unchanged from upstream:

- **Repo:** [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)
- **Docs:** [hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/)
